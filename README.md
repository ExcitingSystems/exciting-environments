# exciting-environments

## Overview
The exctiting-environments package is a toolbox for the simulation of physical [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) wrapped into [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) environments using [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax). Due to the possible just-in-time compilation of JAX, this type of implementation offers great advantages in terms of simulation speed.
